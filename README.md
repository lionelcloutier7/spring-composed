# Welcome to _Spring Composed_!

This repository is a collection of _composed annotations_ for use with the Spring Framework.

Most annotations in the `spring-composed` project rely on `@AliasFor` which was introduced in Spring Framework 4.2 and therefore require at least Spring Framework 4.2.1 to work properly.
