# Welcome to _Spring Composed_!

This repository is a collection of _composed annotations_ for use with the Spring Framework.

Most annotations in the `spring-composed` project rely on `@AliasFor` which was introduced in Spring Framework 4.2 and therefore require at least Spring Framework 4.2.1 to work properly. 

# Contributing

Although the `spring-composed` project is currently a test bed for experimentation, there is a good chance that annotations from this project will eventually be incorporated into official Spring projects. In order to have your pull requests accepted, we therefore ask that you [sign the Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-the-contributor-license-agreement) and document that you have done so in the commit message or comments of your pull request.
